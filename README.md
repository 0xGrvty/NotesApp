## My small Notes App

This is a small app using the React Framework and a mock JSON server.  Built with guidance from Dennis Ivy's [Teachable course](https://dennisivy.teachable.com/p/react-notes-app-crash-course).

## Usage
npm run server
: Runs the local mock JSON server on localhost:5000.  Run this first in order to create, update, and delete data.

npm run start
: Runs the application on localhost:3000.  Run this next to play around with the application itself.
